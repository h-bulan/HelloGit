This is my first GitHub repository for learning Python.  
It contains simple practice code as I start my journey toward becoming a software engineer.

## Files
- `hello.py`: A simple program that prints "Hello, VS Code!"

## Future Plans
- Add more Python practice scripts
- Build a small web application with Flask (e.g., a ToDo app)
- Continue using this repository to track my learning progress
